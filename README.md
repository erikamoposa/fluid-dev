# Programming Test Detail:


**Background:**

You will be working closely with motors on an actuated robot. This challenge is a typical problem
that will be encountered when working with this robot.

**Problem:**

You will read the joint position value from an encoder from one of the joints of the robot. The
joint position will be given as a number between 0 to 4096, covering 360 degrees of rotation

1. Store that value in a ring buffer
2. Provide functions for calculating the instantaneous
3. Write unit tests for all funcions

**Requirements:**

- Use modern C++
- Use proper software engineering fundamentals and code hygiene
